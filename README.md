# darkstar-csfrs 
A simple client server based cross platform facial recognition system.(Tested on Windows/Linux)

The .zip file contains the server-side files of the project.
I will be adding the client-side files and updating the readme.md soon.

For more info please go here : https://csfrs.eu.org/ (client side)


Update: 20-7-20 - CSFRS1.0
Client side is uploaded as public.html.zip
server side is server.zip
Run main.py after all required python modules are installed


username is :abhinavm17
password is:letmein


Default IP is set in the recognize_faces_video.py change as necessary
(Use IP webcam on android to test)

The 'face-recognition-opencv real WIN10' folder should be in desktop, otherwise you can edit config.py to change.

client side is on csfrs.eu.org, login with :testtest as uname and pw, (you can go back by clicking on the 'CSFRS' text)

3-4 images are required to recognize, upload on client side and package zip, then search target(main.py should be running beforehand)

A video demonstration would be more apt, im working on it.

(Begin- 17/09/18)
