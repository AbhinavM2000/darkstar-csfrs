# darkstar-csfrs 
A simple client server based cross platform facial recognition system.(Tested on Windows/Linux)

The .zip file contains the server-side files of the project.
I will be adding the client-side files and updating the readme.md soon.

For more info please go here : https://csfrs.eu.org/ (client side)


Update: 20-7-20 - CSFRS1.0 <br>
Client side is uploaded as public.html.zip <br>
server side is server.zip <br>
Run main.py after all required python modules are installed <br>


username is :abhinavm17<br>
password is:letmein<br>
(you can change this in config.py)


Default IP is set in the recognize_faces_video.py change as necessary<br>
(Use IP webcam on android to test)<br>

The 'face-recognition-opencv real WIN10' folder should be in desktop, otherwise you can edit config.py to change.<br>

client side is on csfrs.eu.org, login with :testtest as uname and pw,<br>(you need to edit the login.php with your corresponding MySQL database credentials when you implement this on your own webpage)<br> (on the dashboard you can go back by clicking on the 'CSFRS' text)<br>

3-4 images are required to recognize, upload on client side and package zip, then search target(main.py should be running on the server pc beforehand)<br>

A video demonstration would be more apt, im working on it.<br>

Also, add no-cache headers to the web pages for better functioning. <br>
